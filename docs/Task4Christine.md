2. A dropdown menu will appear below the command center. There will be options to change the *visibility* of window elements, the *position* of the Primary Side Bar, the *alignment* of the window panels and what *mode* the VSCode window is in. You can navigate this menu by clicking on the option you would like.

### Visibility

Selecting an element in this menu will toggle whether the element is open in the window. The visibility status of the element is indicated by the eye symbol to the right of the element in this menu.
