It is used for executing commands, running scripts, and managing files and directories. Node.js An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Essential for running and testing JavaScript projects in VSCode. Command Palette A feature in VSCode that provides quick access to commands, features, and settings. It can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac). Explorer The pane in VSCode that allows users to view, navigate, and manage the files and folders in their project. It is part of the Workbench and can be accessed with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+E (Mac). Extensions Marketplace A platform within VSCode that allows users to discover and install extensions to enhance their development experience. Extensions can add support for new languages, themes, debuggers, and other tools. Live Share An extension for VSCode that enables real-time collaborative editing and debugging with others. It allows sharing of the codebase, terminal, and local servers for a seamless pair programming experience. Theme The combination of colours used to customize VSCode's environment and interface. Workbench The overall element that contains all aspects of the VSCode window. Specifically contains the Menu Bar, Activity bar, Primary and Secondary Side Bars, Panel, Status Bar, Editor and Title. Command center The top and centermost bar in the VSCode window. Contains the Workspace name. Window Elements Components of the VSCode window that contain areas of information that a user might need. Able to be made visible, hidden and moved. REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) An interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs (expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. VSCode supports JavaScript REPL through the Node.js runtime. File Explorer A feature within the Explorer in VSCode that provides a graphical interface for accessing and managing project files and directories. Installation &amp; Set Up The initial process of downloading and configuring VSCode and necessary tools (like Node.js) on a user's system to prepare for development activities. Debugging The process of identifying and removing errors from computer software. VSCode provides integrated debugging tools to help developers diagnose and fix issues in their code."},{"location":"Task1Allison/","title":"Set Up","text":""},{"location":"Task1Allison/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>In this section, you will learn how to set up and run a new JavaScript file on Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
